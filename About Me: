As a young child, I was always messing around my computer terminal not understanding what anything meant! This interest eventually led me to teaching myself how to code. I was always interested in my tech class in highschool and I enjoyed it and wanted to do more than make games. This did not last very long as I was trying to learn how to code and also work a full time job in the restaurant business which taught me how to work in fast-paced environments and learn empathy as well as team work. During the height of covid i lost my job and was determined to get back back to my roots and teach myself how to code once again. I know I will be a good candidate for any company because I am driven by learning new code and working on projects as a team. I absolutely love it . If you're looking for a software engineer who takes initiative , is outcome-driven, and with great collaboration skills– let's talk!
